‚úÖ 1. Read the chamber name (hardcoded or passed as input)
bash
Copy
Edit
chamber_id="TV02"  # hardcoded or passed from CLI
CONFIG_PATH="config/config.json"
‚úÖ 2. Extract IPs using jq
The script uses jq to extract IPs:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws_ip=$(jq -r ".chambers[\"$chamber_id\"].nodes.aws" $CONFIG_PATH)
os_ip=$(jq -r ".chambers[\"$chamber_id\"].nodes.openstack" $CONFIG_PATH)
admin_ip=$(jq -r ".chambers[\"$chamber_id\"].admin" $CONFIG_PATH)
Now these variables hold:

aws_ip="172.31.12.150"

os_ip="10.106.42.50"

admin_ip="10.154.96.21"

‚úÖ 3. SSH or SCP using these IPs
The script then runs something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Copy rvm.tar to AWS node
scp /tmp/rvm.tar vsaravan@$aws_ip:/tmp/

# Run remote test
ssh vsaravan@$aws_ip "tar -xf /tmp/rvm.tar && /tmp/rvm/run_tests.sh"

# Pull results
scp vsaravan@$aws_ip:/tmp/report.html ./reports/aws_report.html
Similarly for OpenStack:

bash
Copy
Edit
scp /tmp/rvm.tar vsaravan@$os_ip:/tmp/
ssh vsaravan@$os_ip "tar -xf /tmp/rvm.tar && /tmp/rvm/run_tests.sh"
scp vsaravan@$os_ip:/tmp/report.html ./reports/os_report.html
‚úÖ What Does the Script Expect?
Input	From
Chamber name	Either hardcoded or passed via $1
config/config.json	Must exist before the script starts
jq tool	Must be installed to parse JSON
rvm.tar	Must be in /tmp/
SSH access	The admin node must have key-based access to AWS/OS IPs

üîÑ Summary: Script‚Äôs Role vs config.json
Role	Who Does It
Build config.json	‚úÖ GitHub workflow or pre-script
Use/extract IPs from config.json	‚úÖ cloud3testautomationlauncher.sh
Execute remote jobs	‚úÖ .sh script using IPs
Export back to JSON	‚ùå Not needed ‚Äî results come as reports, not config changes

Would you like me to reverse-engineer the .sh file logic (based on its purpose) and provide you a commented, cleaned-up version?

That way you know exactly where IPs are used, copied, and executed.
